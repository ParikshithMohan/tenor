# Tenor

Tenor is an experimental project to procedurally generate music that doesn't just sound like noise to a listener.

### Objective

The concept of music is incredibly accomodating; anything from industrial noise to baroque classical can be appreciated with enough interest. This makes the problem statement simple - all we need is a random rhythm and melody generator and we could pass off its output as music.

But popular and contemporary music has tuned the ears of the average listener to certain preset patterns in melody, harmony and rhythm. As a result, most of us have developed a collective sense of what makes good music and what doesn't, while in fact, there is no such thing as good or bad music (objectively, of course). Now this makes the problem statement a lot more tangible - generating music is easy, generating music that *sounds good to the human ear* requires more effort.

The project is an attempt at constructing primitive music theory and using it as a base to build procedures that can generate melodies, in-tune to the ears of the average listener.

### Music to the human ears

Most pieces in contemporary music share certain common characteristics in rhythm, harmony and melody. There's a high chance that one or more of these characteristics occur in a song that we happen to discover, and since we're attuned to these patterns already, the melody then becomes instantly identifiable without sounding like random noise.

Some of these idiosyncrasies could be:

- The famed [4/4 time signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature#Most_frequent_time_signatures).
- The [call-and-response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_and_response_%28music%29#Popular_music) pattern.
- Phil Specter's [Wall of Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_Sound).
- The [C-major scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_major).
- Variations of the C-D-G-C chord pattern or other common chord patterns.

Here's a [very interesting analysis](http://www.hooktheory.com/blog/i-analyzed-the-chords-of-1300-popular-songs-for-patterns-this-is-what-i-found/) on common patterns found in over 1300 popular songs.
